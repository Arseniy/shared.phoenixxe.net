/**
* Abstract class <b>SimpleTask</b> implement <b>Task</b> and override all its methods.
* <br>
* It is used for guaranteed execution of custom code and supports:<br>
* - multiple execution attempts if there was no critical errors during execution;
* - execution delay;
* - execution until one of completed() or fail() called.
* <br>
* Method <b>execute()</b> in SimpleTask makes some checks of inner parameters such as <br>
* available, execute delay etc and call <b>perform()</b> (perform() should be implemented<br>
* by the child objects). SimpleTask execute() method don't call completed() or fail() after<br>
* execution but perform() do. So implementation of perform() must organize it.<br>
